# Climate Analysis and Flask API

This project performs a basic climate analysis and data exploration of a climate database using Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Flask. It includes features like precipitation analysis, station analysis, temperature observation analysis, and a Flask API to access the data.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- SQLAlchemy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Flask

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/climate-analysis.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd climate-analysis
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up the database:

   - Place the `hawaii.sqlite` file in the project directory.

## Usage

To run the climate analysis and Flask API, follow these steps:

1. Perform the climate analysis:

   - Open the `climate_analysis.ipynb` file and run the cells sequentially.
   - This will generate visualizations and summary statistics for the precipitation, stations, and temperature observations.

2. Start the Flask API:

   - Run the following command in the project directory:

     ```shell
     python app.py
     ```

3. Access the API endpoints:

   - Open a web browser or API testing tool and use the following routes:

     - `/api/v1.0/precipitation`: Retrieves the last 12 months of precipitation data.
     - `/api/v1.0/stations`: Retrieves a list of stations in the dataset.
     - `/api/v1.0/tobs`: Retrieves the temperature observations of the most-active station for the previous year.
     - `/api/v1.0/<start>`: Retrieves the minimum, average, and maximum temperatures for dates greater than or equal to the specified start date.
     - `/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>`: Retrieves the minimum, average, and maximum temperatures for dates between the specified start and end dates.

4. Example usage:

   - To retrieve the precipitation data in JSON format:

     ```
     http://localhost:5000/api/v1.0/precipitation
     ```

   - To retrieve the list of stations in JSON format:

     ```
     http://localhost:5000/api/v1.0/stations
     ```

## Conclusion

The climate analysis and data exploration provide insights into the precipitation patterns, station observations, and temperature trends in the dataset. The Flask API allows users to access the data through intuitive endpoints, making it convenient for further analysis and integration with other applications.
